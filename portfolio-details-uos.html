              <h2>My Work at the University of Stirling (RAK Branch Campus)</h2>
              <p>
                During my tenure at the University of Stirling (RAK Branch), I worked as a Digital Marketing Manager. In this role, I managed marketing-related communication between the main campus in the UK and our branch campus in Ras Al Khaimah, UAE. I was responsible for maintaining the university's website and analytics, as well as overseeing all digital channels. This included managing and creating content, designing and implementing ad campaigns, and handling various media formats such as photos, videos, and graphic designs. I also worked on print materials such as brochures, leaflets, and roll-up banners.</p>

<p>For the first year, I single-handedly managed all the tasks mentioned above, which provided me with valuable experience and learning opportunities. However, later on, a graphic designer joined my team, allowing us to collaborate and enhance our creative output. Throughout my tenure, I closely collaborated with the admissions team, the marketing team at the main campus in the UK, faculty members, and students. Together, we worked towards developing and maintaining a cohesive brand image that could effectively attract prospective students and their parents, showcasing the unique attributes of our university.
